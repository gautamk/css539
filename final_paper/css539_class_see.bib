	abstract = {Cloud computing is a model to provide convenient, on-demand access to a shared pool configurable computing resources. In cloud computing, {IT}-related capabilities are provided as services, accessible without requiring detailed knowledge of the underlying technologies, and with minimal management effort. The great savings promised by the cloud are however offset by the perceived security threats feared by users. This paper gives an overview of cloud computing, and discusses related security challenges. We emphasize that although there are many technological approaches that can improve cloud security, there are currently no one-size-fits-all solutions, and future work has to tackle challenges such as service level agreements for security, as well as holistic mechanisms for ensuring accountability in the cloud.},

	abstract = {Cloud computing, also on-demand computing, is a kind of Internet-based computing that provides shared processing resources and data to computers and other devices on demand. It is a model for enabling ubiquitous, on-demand access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications and services), which can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort. Cloud computing and storage solutions provide users and enterprises with various capabilities to store and process their data in third-party data centers. It relies on sharing of resources to achieve coherence and economy of scale, similar to a utility (like the electricity grid) over a network.
Advocates claim that cloud computing allows companies to avoid upfront infrastructure costs, and focus on projects that differentiate their businesses instead of on infrastructure. Proponents also claim that cloud computing allows enterprises to get their applications up and running faster, with improved manageability and less maintenance, and enables {IT} to more rapidly adjust resources to meet fluctuating and unpredictable business demand. Cloud providers typically use a "pay as you go" model. This can lead to unexpectedly high charges if administrators do not adapt to the cloud pricing model.
The present availability of high-capacity networks, low-cost computers and storage devices as well as the widespread adoption of hardware virtualization, service-oriented architecture, and autonomic and utility computing have led to a growth in cloud computing. Companies can scale up as computing needs increase and then scale down again as demands decrease.
Cloud computing has become a highly demanded service or utility due to the advantages of high computing power, cheap cost of services, high performance, scalability, accessibility as well as availability. Some cloud vendors are experiencing growth rates of 50\% per year, but being still in a stage of infancy, it has pitfalls that need to be addressed to make cloud computing services more reliable and user friendly.},

In this paper, we present a method, called infinite length hash chains to improve the flexibility of this chaining idea by using public-key techniques. One of its distinguishing features is that communication and computation overhead of restarting of the system is avoided For the owner of the chain it is possible to go in either way in the chain at any time without any restriction in the chain length, but others see no difference as the functionality it provides with respect to traditional hash chains. On the other hand the drawback here is the increased computation cost due to public-key operations. Part of our work would be considered as one additional step after traditional one-time passwords in the natural progression from fixed password schemes to challenge-response identification protocols.},

Vector space secret sharing helps to realize general monotone decreasing structures for the family of subsets of users that can be revoked instead of a threshold one. One way hash chains contribute to reduce communication overhead. Furthermore, the most prominent characteristic of our scheme is resisting collusion between the new joined users and the revoked users, which is fatal weakness of hash function based self-healing key distribution schemes.},

The above mentioned features encourage the organizations and individual users to shift their applications and services to the cloud. Even the critical infrastructure, for example, power generation and distribution plants are being migrated to the cloud computing paradigm. However, the services provided by third-party cloud service providers entail additional security threats. The migration of user’s assets (data, applications, etc.) outside the administrative control in a shared environment where numerous users are collocated escalates the security concerns. This survey details the security issues that arise due to the very nature of cloud computing. Moreover, the survey presents the recent solutions presented in the literature to counter the security issues. Furthermore, a brief view of security vulnerabilities in the mobile cloud computing are also highlighted. In the end, the discussion on the open issues and future research directions is also presented.},

Context assessed the security of a number of cloud service providers and found that some providers exposed clients' data to a risk of compromise as a result of serious flaws in the implementation of their technologies. Michael Jordon of Context details the investigations, the results found and steps taken to remediate the problems.

There must be times when cloud service providers rue the day that the term ‘cloud’ was chosen to describe their technologies. ‘Cloud computing’ sounds light and fresh, a world away from clunky old mainframes, but it also conjures up negative images for corporate users, making one think of something windblown, flimsy and vague — while also somehow opaque and mysterious.},

Services, such as Microsoft's Azure and Amazon's {EC}2, allow users to instantiate virtual machines ({VMs}) on demand and thus purchase precisely the capacity they require when they require it. In turn, the use of virtualization allows third-party cloud providers to maximize the utilization of their sunk capital costs by multiplexing many customer {VMs} across a shared physical infrastructure. However, in this paper, we show that this approach can also introduce new vulnerabilities. Using the Amazon {EC}2 service as a case study, we show that it is possible to map the internal cloud infrastructure, identify where a particular target {VM} is likely to reside, and then instantiate new {VMs} until one is placed co-resident with the target. We explore how such placement can then be used to mount cross-{VM} side-channel attacks to extract information from a target {VM} on the same machine.},

	abstract = {To achieve security in wireless sensor networks, it is important to he able to encrypt messages sent among sensor nodes. Keys for encryption purposes must he agreed upon by communicating nodes. Due to resource constraints, achieving such key agreement in wireless sensor networks is nontrivial. Many key agreement schemes used in general networks, such as Diffie-Hellman and public-key based schemes, are not suitable for wireless sensor networks. Pre-distribution of secret keys for all pairs of nodes is not viable due to the large amount of memory used when the network size is large. Recently, a random key pre-distribution scheme and its improvements have been proposed. A common assumption made by these random key pre-distribution schemes is that no deployment knowledge is available. Noticing that in many practical scenarios, certain deployment knowledge may be available a priori, we propose a novel random key pre-distribution scheme that exploits deployment knowledge and avoids unnecessary key assignments. We show that the performance (including connectivity, memory usage, and network resilience against node capture) of sensor networks can he substantially improved with the use of our proposed scheme. The scheme and its detailed performance evaluation are presented in this paper.},

This has implications for many technical issues in Service Oriented Architectures and Internet of Services ({IoS})-type applications; including fault tolerance, high availability and scalability. Central to these issues is the establishment of effective load balancing techniques. It is clear the scale and complexity of these systems makes centralized assignment of jobs to specific servers infeasible; requiring an effective distributed solution.

	abstract = {We consider basic notions of security for cryptographic hash functions: collision resistance, preimage resistance, and second-preimage resistance. We give seven different definitions that correspond to these three underlying ideas, and then we work out all of the implications and separations among these seven definitions within the concrete-security, provable-security framework. Because our results are concrete, we can show two types of implications, conventional and provisional, where the strength of the latter depends on the amount of compression achieved by the hash function. We also distinguish two types of separations, conditional and unconditional. When constructing counterexamples for our separations, we are careful to preserve specified hash-function domains and ranges; this rules out some pathological counterexamples and makes the separations more meaningful in practice. Four of our definitions are standard while three appear to be new; some of our relations and separations have appeared, others have not. Here we give a modern treatment that acts to catalog, in one place and with carefully-considered nomenclature, the most basic security notions for cryptographic hash functions.},

	abstract = {When we ask what makes a hash function `good', we usually get an answer which includes collision freedom as the main (if not sole) desideratum. However, we show here that given any collision-free function, we can derive others which are also collision-free, but cryptographically useless. This explains why researchers have not managed to find many interesting consequences of this property. We also prove Okamoto's conjecture that correlation freedom is strictly stronger than collision freedom. We go on to show that there are actually rather many properties which hash functions may need. Hash functions for use with {RSA} must be multiplication free, in the sense that one cannot find X , Y and Z such that  h(X)h(Y ) = h(Z); and more complex requirements hold for other signature schemes. Universal principles can be proposed from which all the freedom properties follow, but like most theoretical principles, they do not seem to give much value to a designer; at the practical level, the main imp...},

	abstract = {One-way chains are an important cryptographic primitive in many security applications. As one-way chains are very efficient to verify, they recently became increasingly popular for designing security protocols for resource-constrained mobile devices and sensor networks, as their low-powered processors can compute a one-way function within milliseconds, but would require tens of seconds or up to minutes to generate or verify a traditional digital signature [6]. Recent sensor network security protocols thus extensively use one-way chains to design protocols that scale down to resource-constrained sensors [21,29]. Recently, researchers also proposed a variety of improvements to one-way hash chains to make storage and access more efficient [9,18,33], or to make setup and verification more efficient [17,21]. In this paper we present two new constructions for one-way hash chains, which significantly improve the efficiency of one-way chains. Our first construction, the Sandwich-chain, provides a smaller bandwidth overhead for one-way chain values, and enables efficient verification of one-way chain values if the trusted one-way chain value is far away. Our second construction, Comb Skipchain, features a new lower bound for one-way chains in terms of storage and traversal overhead. In fact previously, researchers [9] cite a lower bound of log2(n) for the product of per-value traversal overhead and memory requirements for one-dimensional chains. We show that one can achieve a lower bound by considering multi-dimensional chains. In particular, our two-dimensional construction requires O(log(n)) memory and O(1) traversal overhead, thereby improving on the one-dimensional bound. In addition, the setup cost for the one-way chain is in contrast only O(n/log(n)). Other benefits for both constructions include a faster verification step than the traditional hash chains provide; a verifier can “catch up” efficiently, after having missed some number of previously released hash values (for the Sandwich-chain); and resistance against {DoS} attacks on authentication values. Moreover, we describe fractal traversal schemes for our proposed structures, bringing down the traversal costs for our structure to the same as those of the simpler “traditional” hash chain. Our new construction is orthogonal to most previously proposed techniques, and can be used in conjunction with techniques for efficient setup or verification of one-way chains.},

	abstract = {A cryptographic hash function is a mathematical algorithm that maps data of arbitrary size to a bit string of a fixed size (a hash function) which is designed to also be one-way function, that is, a function which is infeasible to invert. The only way to recreate the input data from an ideal cryptographic hash function's output is to try a large number of possible inputs to see if they produce a match. Bruce Schneier has called one-way hash functions "the workhorses of modern cryptography". The input data is often called the message, and the output (the hash value or hash) is often called the message digest or simply the digest.
The ideal cryptographic hash function has four main properties:
it is quick to compute the hash value for any given message
it is infeasible to generate a message from its hash value except by trying all possible messages
a small change to a message should change the hash value so extensively that the new hash value appears uncorrelated with the old hash value
it is infeasible to find two different messages with the same hash value
Cryptographic hash functions have many information-security applications, notably in digital signatures, message authentication codes ({MACs}), and other forms of authentication. They can also be used as ordinary hash functions, to index data in hash tables, for fingerprinting, to detect duplicate data or uniquely identify files, and as checksums to detect accidental data corruption. Indeed, in information-security contexts, cryptographic hash values are sometimes called (digital) fingerprints, checksums, or just hash values, even though all these terms stand for more general functions with rather different properties and purposes.},

	abstract = {Cloud computing is a model to provide convenient, on-demand access to a shared pool configurable computing resources. In cloud computing, {IT}-related capabilities are provided as services, accessible without requiring detailed knowledge of the underlying technologies, and with minimal management effort. The great savings promised by the cloud are however offset by the perceived security threats feared by users. This paper gives an overview of cloud computing, and discusses related security challenges. We emphasize that although there are many technological approaches that can improve cloud security, there are currently no one-size-fits-all solutions, and future work has to tackle challenges such as service level agreements for security, as well as holistic mechanisms for ensuring accountability in the cloud.},

	abstract = {Cloud computing, also on-demand computing, is a kind of Internet-based computing that provides shared processing resources and data to computers and other devices on demand. It is a model for enabling ubiquitous, on-demand access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications and services), which can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort. Cloud computing and storage solutions provide users and enterprises with various capabilities to store and process their data in third-party data centers. It relies on sharing of resources to achieve coherence and economy of scale, similar to a utility (like the electricity grid) over a network.
Advocates claim that cloud computing allows companies to avoid upfront infrastructure costs, and focus on projects that differentiate their businesses instead of on infrastructure. Proponents also claim that cloud computing allows enterprises to get their applications up and running faster, with improved manageability and less maintenance, and enables {IT} to more rapidly adjust resources to meet fluctuating and unpredictable business demand. Cloud providers typically use a "pay as you go" model. This can lead to unexpectedly high charges if administrators do not adapt to the cloud pricing model.
The present availability of high-capacity networks, low-cost computers and storage devices as well as the widespread adoption of hardware virtualization, service-oriented architecture, and autonomic and utility computing have led to a growth in cloud computing. Companies can scale up as computing needs increase and then scale down again as demands decrease.
Cloud computing has become a highly demanded service or utility due to the advantages of high computing power, cheap cost of services, high performance, scalability, accessibility as well as availability. Some cloud vendors are experiencing growth rates of 50\% per year, but being still in a stage of infancy, it has pitfalls that need to be addressed to make cloud computing services more reliable and user friendly.},

In this paper, we present a method, called infinite length hash chains to improve the flexibility of this chaining idea by using public-key techniques. One of its distinguishing features is that communication and computation overhead of restarting of the system is avoided For the owner of the chain it is possible to go in either way in the chain at any time without any restriction in the chain length, but others see no difference as the functionality it provides with respect to traditional hash chains. On the other hand the drawback here is the increased computation cost due to public-key operations. Part of our work would be considered as one additional step after traditional one-time passwords in the natural progression from fixed password schemes to challenge-response identification protocols.},

The scheme bases on vector space secret sharing and one way hash function techniques. Vector space secret sharing helps to realize general monotone decreasing structures for the family of subsets of users that can be revoked instead of a threshold one. One way hash chains contribute to reduce communication overhead. Furthermore, the most prominent characteristic of our scheme is resisting collusion between the new joined users and the revoked users, which is fatal weakness of hash function based self-healing key distribution schemes.},

The above mentioned features encourage the organizations and individual users to shift their applications and services to the cloud. Even the critical infrastructure, for example, power generation and distribution plants are being migrated to the cloud computing paradigm. However, the services provided by third-party cloud service providers entail additional security threats. The migration of user’s assets (data, applications, etc.) outside the administrative control in a shared environment where numerous users are collocated escalates the security concerns. This survey details the security issues that arise due to the very nature of cloud computing. Moreover, the survey presents the recent solutions presented in the literature to counter the security issues. Furthermore, a brief view of security vulnerabilities in the mobile cloud computing are also highlighted. In the end, the discussion on the open issues and future research directions is also presented.},

Context assessed the security of a number of cloud service providers and found that some providers exposed clients' data to a risk of compromise as a result of serious flaws in the implementation of their technologies. Michael Jordon of Context details the investigations, the results found and steps taken to remediate the problems.

There must be times when cloud service providers rue the day that the term ‘cloud’ was chosen to describe their technologies. ‘Cloud computing’ sounds light and fresh, a world away from clunky old mainframes, but it also conjures up negative images for corporate users, making one think of something windblown, flimsy and vague — while also somehow opaque and mysterious.},

Services, such as Microsoft's Azure and Amazon's {EC}2, allow users to instantiate virtual machines ({VMs}) on demand and thus purchase precisely the capacity they require when they require it. In turn, the use of virtualization allows third-party cloud providers to maximize the utilization of their sunk capital costs by multiplexing many customer {VMs} across a shared physical infrastructure. However, in this paper, we show that this approach can also introduce new vulnerabilities. Using the Amazon {EC}2 service as a case study, we show that it is possible to map the internal cloud infrastructure, identify where a particular target {VM} is likely to reside, and then instantiate new {VMs} until one is placed co-resident with the target. We explore how such placement can then be used to mount cross-{VM} side-channel attacks to extract information from a target {VM} on the same machine.},

	abstract = {To achieve security in wireless sensor networks, it is important to he able to encrypt messages sent among sensor nodes. Keys for encryption purposes must he agreed upon by communicating nodes. Due to resource constraints, achieving such key agreement in wireless sensor networks is nontrivial. Many key agreement schemes used in general networks, such as Diffie-Hellman and public-key based schemes, are not suitable for wireless sensor networks. Pre-distribution of secret keys for all pairs of nodes is not viable due to the large amount of memory used when the network size is large. Recently, a random key pre-distribution scheme and its improvements have been proposed. A common assumption made by these random key pre-distribution schemes is that no deployment knowledge is available. Noticing that in many practical scenarios, certain deployment knowledge may be available a priori, we propose a novel random key pre-distribution scheme that exploits deployment knowledge and avoids unnecessary key assignments. We show that the performance (including connectivity, memory usage, and network resilience against node capture) of sensor networks can he substantially improved with the use of our proposed scheme. The scheme and its detailed performance evaluation are presented in this paper.},

Because our results are concrete, we can show two types of implications, conventional and provisional, where the strength of the latter depends on the amount of compression achieved by the hash function. We also distinguish two types of separations, conditional and unconditional. When constructing counterexamples for our separations, we are careful to preserve specified hash-function domains and ranges; this rules out some pathological counterexamples and makes the separations more meaningful in practice. Four of our definitions are standard while three appear to be new; some of our relations and separations have appeared, others have not. Here we give a modern treatment that acts to catalog, in one place and with carefully-considered nomenclature, the most basic security notions for cryptographic hash functions.},

However, we show here that given any collision-free function, we can derive others which are also collision-free, but cryptographically useless. This explains why researchers have not managed to find many interesting consequences of this property. We also prove Okamoto's conjecture that correlation freedom is strictly stronger than collision freedom. We go on to show that there are actually rather many properties which hash functions may need. Hash functions for use with {RSA} must be multiplication free, in the sense that one cannot find X , Y and Z such that  h(X)h(Y ) = h(Z); and more complex requirements hold for other signature schemes. Universal principles can be proposed from which all the freedom properties follow, but like most theoretical principles, they do not seem to give much value to a designer; at the practical level, the main imp...},

	abstract = {One-way chains are an important cryptographic primitive in many security applications. As one-way chains are very efficient to verify, they recently became increasingly popular for designing security protocols for resource-constrained mobile devices and sensor networks, as their low-powered processors can compute a one-way function within milliseconds, but would require tens of seconds or up to minutes to generate or verify a traditional digital signature [6]. Recent sensor network security protocols thus extensively use one-way chains to design protocols that scale down to resource-constrained sensors [21,29]. Recently, researchers also proposed a variety of improvements to one-way hash chains to make storage and access more efficient [9,18,33], or to make setup and verification more efficient [17,21]. In this paper we present two new constructions for one-way hash chains, which significantly improve the efficiency of one-way chains. Our first construction, the Sandwich-chain, provides a smaller bandwidth overhead for one-way chain values, and enables efficient verification of one-way chain values if the trusted one-way chain value is far away. Our second construction, Comb Skipchain, features a new lower bound for one-way chains in terms of storage and traversal overhead. In fact previously, researchers [9] cite a lower bound of log2(n) for the product of per-value traversal overhead and memory requirements for one-dimensional chains. We show that one can achieve a lower bound by considering multi-dimensional chains. In particular, our two-dimensional construction requires O(log(n)) memory and O(1) traversal overhead, thereby improving on the one-dimensional bound. In addition, the setup cost for the one-way chain is in contrast only O(n/log(n)). Other benefits for both constructions include a faster verification step than the traditional hash chains provide; a verifier can “catch up” efficiently, after having missed some number of previously released hash values (for the Sandwich-chain); and resistance against {DoS} attacks on authentication values. Moreover, we describe fractal traversal schemes for our proposed structures, bringing down the traversal costs for our structure to the same as those of the simpler “traditional” hash chain. Our new construction is orthogonal to most previously proposed techniques, and can be used in conjunction with techniques for efficient setup or verification of one-way chains.},

	abstract = {A cryptographic hash function is a mathematical algorithm that maps data of arbitrary size to a bit string of a fixed size (a hash function) which is designed to also be one-way function, that is, a function which is infeasible to invert. The only way to recreate the input data from an ideal cryptographic hash function's output is to try a large number of possible inputs to see if they produce a match. Bruce Schneier has called one-way hash functions "the workhorses of modern cryptography". The input data is often called the message, and the output (the hash value or hash) is often called the message digest or simply the digest.
The ideal cryptographic hash function has four main properties:
it is quick to compute the hash value for any given message
it is infeasible to generate a message from its hash value except by trying all possible messages
a small change to a message should change the hash value so extensively that the new hash value appears uncorrelated with the old hash value
it is infeasible to find two different messages with the same hash value
Cryptographic hash functions have many information-security applications, notably in digital signatures, message authentication codes ({MACs}), and other forms of authentication. They can also be used as ordinary hash functions, to index data in hash tables, for fingerprinting, to detect duplicate data or uniquely identify files, and as checksums to detect accidental data corruption. Indeed, in information-security contexts, cryptographic hash values are sometimes called (digital) fingerprints, checksums, or just hash values, even though all these terms stand for more general functions with rather different properties and purposes.},

The hope is that constructing a successful exploit requires analyzing properties of the system, and that in the time it takes an attacker to learn those properties and construct the exploit, the system will have changed enough by the time the attacker can launch the exploit to disrupt the exploit’s functionality. This is a promising and appealing idea, but its security impact is not yet clearly understood. In this chapter, we argue that the actual benefits of the moving target approach are in fact often much less significant than one would expect. We present a model for thinking about dynamic diversity defenses, analyze the security properties of a few example defenses and attacks, and identify scenarios where moving target defenses are and are not effective.},

User-created Web content is a notorious vector for cross-site scripting ({XSS}) attacks that target Web sites and confidential user data. In this threat climate, mechanisms that render web applications immune to {XSS} attacks have been of recent research interest.A challenge for these security mechanisms is enabling Web applications to accept complex {HTML} input from users, while disallowing malicious script content. This challenge is made difficult by anomalous Web browser behaviors, which are often used as vectors for successful {XSS} attacks.Motivated by this problem, we present a new {XSS} defense strategy designed to be effective in widely deployed existing Web browsers, despite anomalous browser behavior. Our approach seeks to minimize trust placed on browsers for interpreting untrusted content. We implemented this approach in a tool called Blueprint that was integrated with several popular Web applications. We evaluated Blueprint against a barrage of stress tests that demonstrate strong resistance to attacks, excellent compatibility with Web browsers and reasonable performance overheads.},

We investigate the complexity of breaking hash function security properties by hash chain attacks using probabilistic algorithms. We show that each hash function has a vulnerability index that measures its inherent vulnerability against hash chains attacks. The vulnerability index is invariant with respect to different types of hash chain attacks using probabilistic algorithms with or without an oracle. It provides a criterion for the evaluation of the prevalent hash functions and also be used as a guide for the design of new hash functions. We analyze the properties of the vulnerability indices and estimate their values of the commonly used hash functions: {MD}5, {SHA}1, {RIPEMD}128 and {RIPEMD}160.

Central to these issues is the establishment of effective load balancing techniques. It is clear the scale and complexity of these systems makes centralized assignment of jobs to specific servers infeasible; requiring an effective distributed solution. This paper investigates three possible distributed solutions proposed for load balancing; approaches inspired by Honeybee Foraging Behaviour, Biased Random Sampling and Active Clustering.},

	abstract = {Provisioning of multi-tier applications in cloud environments raises new challenges not addressed by prior work on provisioning single-tier applications, on dynamic balancing or on resource allocation in other types of distributed systems. Flexible and general automatic mechanisms are needed to determine how much virtual resources need to be allocated to each tier of the application minimizing resources consumption and meeting the service level agreement. Both the research community and the main cloud providers are proposing this kind of solutions but most of them are application-specific, provider-specific, centralized and focused only on batch applications. This paper presents an automatic provisioning solution for multi-tier applications called {AutoMAP}. The proposed mechanism is general (application and provider independent), it can be implemented with different architectures from centralized to distributed even being provided as a service, and it is able to deal with both batch and interactive applications allowing horizontal and vertical scaling (based on replication and on resizing respectively). A first prototype of {AutoMAP} has been implemented to demonstrate its efficiency with experimental results using a widely used benchmark, {RUBiS}, on a real cloud architecture.},

	abstract = {The difficulty of scaling Online Social Networks ({OSNs}) has introduced new system design challenges that has often caused costly re-architecting for services like Twitter and Facebook. The complexity of interconnection of users in social networks has introduced new scalability challenges. Conventional vertical scaling by resorting to full replication can be a costly proposition. Horizontal scaling by partitioning and distributing data among multiples servers - e.g. using {DHTs} - can lead to costly inter-server communication. We design, implement, and evaluate {SPAR}, a social partitioning and replication middle-ware that transparently leverages the social graph structure to achieve data locality while minimizing replication. {SPAR} guarantees that for all users in an {OSN}, their direct neighbor's data is co-located in the same server. The gains from this approach are multi-fold: application developers can assume local semantics, i.e., develop as they would for a single server; scalability is achieved by adding commodity servers with low memory and network I/O requirements; and redundancy is achieved at a fraction of the cost. We detail our system design and an evaluation based on datasets from Twitter, Orkut, and Facebook, with a working implementation. We show that {SPAR} incurs minimum overhead, and can help a well-known open-source Twitter clone reach Twitter's scale without changing a line of its application logic and achieves higher throughput than Cassandra, Facebook's {DHT} based key-value store database.},

	abstract = {Enterprise clouds today support an on demand resource allocation model and can provide resources requested by applications in a near online manner using virtual machine resizing or cloning. However, in order to take advantage of an on demand resource model, enterprise applications need to be automatically scaled in a way that makes the most efficient use of resources. In this work, we present the {SmartScale} automated scaling framework. {SmartScale} uses a combination of vertical (adding more resources to existing {VM} instances) and horizontal (adding more {VM} instances) scaling to ensure that the application is scaled in a manner that optimizes both resource usage and the reconfiguration cost incurred due to scaling. The {SmartScale} methodology is proactive and ensures that the application converges quickly to the desired scaling level even when the workload intensity changes significantly. We evaluate {SmartScale} using real production traces on Olio, an emerging cloud benchmark, running on a kvm-based cloud testbed. We present both theoretical and experimental evidence that comprehensively establish the effectiveness of {SmartScale}.},

	abstract = {In 1998, Blaze, Bleumer and Strauss put forth a cryptographic primitive, termed proxy re-encryption, where a semi-trusted proxy is given some piece of information that enables the re-encryption of ciphertexts from one key to another. Unidirectional schemes only allow translating from the delegator to the delegatee and not in the opposite direction. In all constructions described so far, although colluding proxies and delegatees cannot expose the delegator’s long term secret, they can derive and disclose sub-keys that suffice to open all translatable ciphertexts sent to the delegator. They can also generate new re-encryption keys for receivers that are not trusted by the delegator. In this paper, we propose traceable proxy re-encryption systems, where proxies that leak their re-encryption key can be identified by the delegator. The primitive does not preclude illegal transfers of delegation but rather strives to deter them. We give security definitions for this new primitive and a construction meeting the formalized requirements. This construction is fairly efficient, with ciphertexts that have logarithmic size in the number of delegations, but uses a non-black-box tracing algorithm. We discuss how to provide the scheme with a black box tracing mechanism at the expense of longer ciphertexts.},

However, the security of cloud computing is always the focus of numerous potential cloud customers, and a big barrier for its widespread applications. In this paper, to facilitate customers to understand the security status quo of cloud computing and contribute some efforts to improving the security level of cloud computing, we surveyed the existing popular security models of cloud computing, e.g. multiple-tenancy model, risk accumulation model, cube model of cloud computing, and summarized the main security risks of cloud computing deriving from different organizations. Finally, we gave some security strategies from the perspective of construction, operation and security incident response to relieve the common security issues of cloud computing.},

We evaluate the cost of six scheduling strategies used by an organisation that operates a cluster managed by virtual machine technology and seeks to utilise resources from a remote Infrastructure as a Service ({IaaS}) provider to reduce the response time of its user requests. Requests for virtual machines are submitted to the organisation's cluster, but additional virtual machines are instantiated in the remote provider and added to the local cluster when there are insufficient resources to serve the users' requests. Naïve scheduling strategies can have a great impact on the amount paid by the organisation for using the remote resources, potentially increasing the overall cost with the use of {IaaS}. Therefore, in this work we investigate six scheduling strategies that consider the use of resources from the "Cloud", to understand how these strategies achieve a balance between performance and usage cost, and how much they improve the requests' response times.},

	abstract = {With the rapid development of processing and storage technologies and the success of the Internet, computing resources have become cheaper, more powerful and more available than ever before. This technological trend has enabled the realization of a new computing model called cloud computing, in which resources are provided as general utilities that can be leased and released by users through the Internet in an on-demand fashion. The organizations are gaining more experience in the cloud and they start to shift more core business functions onto cloud platforms. Because of this fact, we are seeing that cloud adoption is significantly more complex than we imagined initially, particularly in terms of data management, system integration and the management of multiple cloud providers. Cloud computing is of growing interest to companies around the globe, but many are finding greater costs and greater obstacles to the adoption of cloud computing than they anticipated. In this case, is cloud computing still able to deliver all the promises? In this paper we will analyze from a company's point of view the factors that need to be considered by an enterprise when making the decision of using cloud computing. Some of the companies are moving towards cloud computing just because it is the latest trend in information technology. On the other hand, other companies cannot even take into consideration the idea of having their sensitive data outside their premises. Both of these cases represent companies that are just not very well informed. We are not sustaining that cloud computing is a perfect solution for everybody, but adopting it or not should be result of a very well informed analysis. We will analyze the positive and negative aspects of each of the following factors: integration with existing {IT} infrastructure and existing software, costs, return on investment, performances, security. Also, we will correlate all these factors with the company size and business area in order to identify if or what type of cloud computing solution is suitable for their needs.},

	abstract = {The Internet Protocol version 6 ({IPv}6) brings with it a seemingly endless supply of network addresses. It does not, however, solve many of the vulnerabilities that existed in Internet Protocol version 4 ({IPv}4). In fact, privacy-related crimes in {IPv}6 are made easier due to the way {IPv}6 addresses are formed. We developed a Moving Target {IPv}6 Defense ({MT}6D) that leverages the immense address space of {IPv}6. The two goals of {MT}6D are maintaining user privacy and protecting against targeted network attacks. These goals are achieved by repeatedly rotating the addresses of both the sender and receiver. Address rotation occurs, regardless of the state of ongoing sessions, to prevent an attacker from discovering the identities of the two communicating hosts. Rotating addresses mid-session prevents an attacker from even determining that the same two hosts are communicating. The continuously changing addresses also force an attacker to repeatedly reacquire the target node before he or she can launch a successful network attack. Our proof of concept demonstrates the feasibility of {MT}6D and its ability to seamlessly bind new {IPv}6 addresses. We also demonstrate {MT}6D's ability to rotate addresses mid-session without dropping or renegotiating sessions. Since {MT}6D operates at the network layer of the protocol stack, it provides a powerful moving target solution that is both platform and application independent.},

Many academic works have created {MTDs} in different deployment environments. However, network-based {MTDs} ({NMTDs}) share key components and properties that determine their effectiveness. In this work, we identify and define seven properties common to {NMTDs} which are key to ensuring the effectiveness of the approach. We then evaluate four {NMTD} systems using these properties and found two or more key concerns for each of the systems. This analysis shows that these properties may help guide developers of new {NMTD} systems by guiding the evaluation of these systems and can be used by others as a rubric to assess the strengths and limitations of each {NMTD} approach.},

While specialized experiments can be constructed to evaluate specific defenses, there is a need for a general approach that will facilitate such tasks. In this work we introduce {VINE}, a high-fidelity cyber experimentation environment designed for the study and evaluation of dynamic and moving target defenses. {VINE} provides a common infrastructure supporting the construction, deployment, execution, and monitoring of complex mission-driven network scenarios that are fully instrumented. The tool was designed to be scalable, extensible, and highly configurable to enable the study of cyber defense strategies under dynamic background traffic and attack conditions, making {VINE} well-suited for the study of adaptive and moving target defenses. In this paper we introduce the {VINE} approach, the {VINE} architecture for {MTD} experimentation, and provide an illustrative example of the framework in action.},

Specifically we demonstrate an implementation of this scheme integrated with an existing {MTD} implemented in the {IPv}6 space: the Moving Target {IPv}6 Defense ({MT}6D). We show how {MT}6D peers can use this protocol to exchange configuration information, allowing them to locate other nodes as they move around the Internet, and how they can securely establish connections and related association parameters with no prior knowledge of the other party's network state. We require a minimal amount of pre-shared information between nodes; only that peers have access to public key information. This scheme enables mobility for peers within the {MT}6D protocol, allows dynamically changing configurations, and allows an {MT}6D server to scale to supporting many clients without a quadratic explosion in the number of secret keys which need to be maintained.},

	abstract = {The commodity status of Field Programmable Gate Arrays ({FPGAs}) has allowed computationally intensive algorithms, such as cryptographic protocols, to take advantage of faster hardware speed while simultaneously leveraging the reconfigurability and lower cost of software. Numerous security applications have been transitioned into {FPGA} implementations allowing security applications to operate at real-time speeds, such as firewall and packet scanning on high speed networks. However, the utilization of {FPGAs} to directly secure software vulnerabilities is seemingly non-existent. Protecting program integrity and confidentiality is crucial as malicious attacks through injected code are becoming increasingly prevalent. This paper lays the foundation of continuing research in how to protect software by partitioning critical sections using reconfigurable hardware. This approach is similar to a traditional coprocessor approach to scheduling opcodes for execution on specialized hardware as opposed to running on the native processor. However, the partitioned program model enables the programmer the ability to split portions of an application to reconfigurable hardware at compile time. The fundamental underlying hypothesis is that synthesizing portions of programs onto hardware can mitigate potential software vulnerabilities. Further, this approach provides an avenue for randomization or diversity for software layout and circuit variation.},

	abstract = {Moving target systems can help defenders limit the utility of reconnaissance for adversaries, hindering the effectiveness of attacks. While moving target systems are a topic of robust research, we find that prior work in network-based moving target defenses has limitations in either scalability or the ability to protect public servers accessible to unmodified clients. In this work, we present a new moving target defense using software-defined networking ({SDN}) that can service unmodified clients while avoiding scalability limitations. We then evaluate this approach according to seven moving-target properties and evaluate its performance. We find that the approach achieves its security goals while introducing low overheads.},

	abstract = {The static one-to-one binding of hosts to {IP} addresses allows adversaries to conduct thorough reconnaissance in order to discover and enumerate network assets. Specifically, this fixed address mapping allows distributed network scanners to aggregate information gathered at multiple locations over different times in order to construct an accurate and persistent view of the network. The unvarying nature of this view enables adversaries to collaboratively share and reuse their collected reconnaissance information in various stages of attack planning and execution. This paper presents a novel moving target defense ({MTD}) technique which enables host-to-{IP} binding of each destination host to vary randomly across the network based on the source identity (spatial randomization) as well as time (temporal randomization). This spatio-temporal randomization will distort attackers' view of the network by causing the collected reconnaissance information to expire as adversaries transition from one host to another or if they stay long enough in one location. Consequently, adversaries are forced to re-scan the network frequently at each location or over different time intervals. These recurring probings significantly raises the bar for the adversaries by slowing down the attack progress, while improving its detectability. We introduce three novel metrics for quantifying the effectiveness of {MTD} defense techniques: deterrence, deception, and detectability. Using these metrics, we perform rigorous theoretical and experimental analysis to evaluate the efficacy of this approach. These analyses show that our approach is effective in countering a significant number of sophisticated threat models including collaborative reconnaissance, worm propagation, and advanced persistent threat ({APT}), in an evasion-free manner.},

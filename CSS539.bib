	abstract = {Cloud computing is a model to provide convenient, on-demand access to a shared pool configurable computing resources. In cloud computing, {IT}-related capabilities are provided as services, accessible without requiring detailed knowledge of the underlying technologies, and with minimal management effort. The great savings promised by the cloud are however offset by the perceived security threats feared by users. This paper gives an overview of cloud computing, and discusses related security challenges. We emphasize that although there are many technological approaches that can improve cloud security, there are currently no one-size-fits-all solutions, and future work has to tackle challenges such as service level agreements for security, as well as holistic mechanisms for ensuring accountability in the cloud.},

	abstract = {Cloud computing, also on-demand computing, is a kind of Internet-based computing that provides shared processing resources and data to computers and other devices on demand. It is a model for enabling ubiquitous, on-demand access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications and services), which can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort. Cloud computing and storage solutions provide users and enterprises with various capabilities to store and process their data in third-party data centers. It relies on sharing of resources to achieve coherence and economy of scale, similar to a utility (like the electricity grid) over a network.
Advocates claim that cloud computing allows companies to avoid upfront infrastructure costs, and focus on projects that differentiate their businesses instead of on infrastructure. Proponents also claim that cloud computing allows enterprises to get their applications up and running faster, with improved manageability and less maintenance, and enables {IT} to more rapidly adjust resources to meet fluctuating and unpredictable business demand. Cloud providers typically use a "pay as you go" model. This can lead to unexpectedly high charges if administrators do not adapt to the cloud pricing model.
The present availability of high-capacity networks, low-cost computers and storage devices as well as the widespread adoption of hardware virtualization, service-oriented architecture, and autonomic and utility computing have led to a growth in cloud computing. Companies can scale up as computing needs increase and then scale down again as demands decrease.
Cloud computing has become a highly demanded service or utility due to the advantages of high computing power, cheap cost of services, high performance, scalability, accessibility as well as availability. Some cloud vendors are experiencing growth rates of 50\% per year, but being still in a stage of infancy, it has pitfalls that need to be addressed to make cloud computing services more reliable and user friendly.},

	abstract = {Hash chains are used extensively in various cryptography applications such as one-time passwords, server-supported signatures and micropayments. In this paper, we present a method, called infinite length hash chains to improve the flexibility of this chaining idea by using public-key techniques. One of its distinguishing features is that communication and computation overhead of restarting of the system is avoided For the owner of the chain it is possible to go in either way in the chain at any time without any restriction in the chain length, but others see no difference as the functionality it provides with respect to traditional hash chains. On the other hand the drawback here is the increased computation cost due to public-key operations. Part of our work would be considered as one additional step after traditional one-time passwords in the natural progression from fixed password schemes to challenge-response identification protocols.},

	doi = {10.1109/WOWMOM.2008.4594921},
	abstract = {An efficient self-healing key distribution scheme with revocation capability is proposed for secure group communication in wireless networks. The scheme bases on vector space secret sharing and one way hash function techniques. Vector space secret sharing helps to realize general monotone decreasing structures for the family of subsets of users that can be revoked instead of a threshold one. One way hash chains contribute to reduce communication overhead. Furthermore, the most prominent characteristic of our scheme is resisting collusion between the new joined users and the revoked users, which is fatal weakness of hash function based self-healing key distribution schemes.},
